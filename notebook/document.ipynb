Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24].

The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed.

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\n6'),\n",

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [31]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9'),\n",

Major participants in smart healthcare can\\nbe classiﬁed into three categories, i.e., the public, health-\\ncare service providers, and third-party healthcare participants.\\nRelated to the participants, representative smart healthcare\\nscenarios include smart homes, smart hospitals, intelligent\\nresearch and development for life science, health management,\\npublic health, rehabilitation therapy, and etc. Fig. 1 shows the\\nmajor participants, emerging technologies, and representative\\nscenarios of smart healthcare.\\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a subﬁeld of com-\\nputer science and artiﬁcial intelligence that is concerned with\\nBinggui Zhou is with the School of Intelligent Systems Science and\\nEngineering, Jinan University, Zhuhai 519070, China; and also with the State\\nKey Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City and the Department of\\nElectrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macao 999078,\\nChina.\\nGuanghua Yang is with the School of Intelligent Systems Science and\\nEngineering, Jinan University, Zhuhai 519070, China.\\nZheng Shi is with the School of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineer-\\ning, Jinan University, Zhuhai 519070, China; and also with the State Key\\nLaboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau, Macao\\n999078, China.\\nShaodan Ma is with the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for\\nSmart City and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,\\nUniversity of Macau, Macao 999078, China.\\n\\x00Corresponding authors: Guanghua Yang (ghyang@jnu.edu.cn), Shaodan\\nMa (shaodanma@um.edu.mo).\\nthe automatic analysis, representation and understanding of\\nhuman language [2]. NLP has become a hot research area\\nand has attracted widespread attention from many research\\ncommunities in the past several years. As human language\\nis a general form of data entry for intelligent systems, NLP\\nenables machines to understand human language and interact\\nwith humans, making it essential to smart healthcare.\\nThe main manifestations of natural language are text and\\nspeech, where text encompasses text records, articles, book\\nchapters, dictionaries, and so forth, while speech occurs in\\nhuman-human and human-machine dialogues. NLP has been\\ndeveloped for several decades following the early origin of\\nartiﬁcial intelligence in the 1950s. Approaches to conduct\\nNLP are generally divided into three categories: rule-based\\napproaches, statistical approaches, and deep learning-based\\napproaches. From the 1950s to 1980s, NLP research mainly\\nfocused on rule-based approaches, which required expertise in\\nboth computer science and linguistics to design rules that ﬁt\\nhuman language. However, even well-designed rules are quite\\nlimited for covering human language due to its ﬂexibility and\\ncomplex patterns. Since the 1980s, statistical NLP systems\\nhave been designed by extracting features from corpora using\\nstatistical and machine learning algorithms and have gradually\\nreplaced rule-based NLP systems due to their superiority in\\nperformance and robustness. With the early application of\\nthe neural probabilistic language model [3] and the rapid\\ndevelopment of deep learning since 2013, neural NLP, by\\nusing neural networks and large corpora for automated feature\\nlearning, has dominated current research and achieved SOTA\\nperformance of many NLP tasks.\\nIn smart healthcare, NLP is applied to process text data and\\nis associated with human-machine/human-human communica-\\ntion. The text data can be classiﬁed into 2 categories: clinical\\ntext and other text data. Clinical text comes from all clinical\\nscenarios and mainly comprises of unstructured text records\\nfrom electronic health record (EHR) systems, including med-\\nical notes, diagnostic reports, electronic prescriptions, and\\netc. Other text data include all text that appears within other\\nhealthcare scenarios, e.g., surveys in population screening and\\narticles for evidence-based reference. Communication is com-\\nmon in all smart healthcare scenarios, such as patient-provider\\ncommunication in clinical inquiry and human-robot interaction\\nin rehabilitation therapy, accompanied by applications such\\nas machine translations and user interfaces for rehabilitation\\nrobots.\\nAs well recognized, research on and applications of NLP\\nfor smart healthcare have received intensive attention in recent\\nyears. However, no study has offered a well-organized sum-\\nmary of existing works in a systematic way. In this paper, we\\nﬁrst provide a systematic review of NLP for smart healthcare\\n© 2022 IEEE.

NLP FOR SMART HEALTHCARE FROM TECHNICAL\\nPERSPECTIVE\\nNLP has been undergoing continuous development since the\\n1950s. Studies on NLP for smart healthcare have also been\\nconducted for decades and have attracted increased attention\\nin recent years with the advancement of artiﬁcial intelligence\\nand general NLP. To connect existing works from technical\\nperspective, in this section, we ﬁrst introduce the three kinds of\\nNLP approaches and their representative algorithms, and then\\nintroduce the NLP pipeline for smart healthcare to show how\\nNLP techniques are used in real smart healthcare applications.\\nA. Comparisons of different NLP approaches\\nThe mainstream NLP approaches can be classiﬁed into three\\ncategories, i.e., rule-based NLP, statistical NLP and neural\\nNLP, which have different characteristics. Below, we discuss\\nthe advantage and disadvantages of the three categories and\\nintroduce the representative algorithms of them.\\nRule-based NLP approaches, e.g., pattern matching [4]\\nand parsing [5], could be quite accurate in speciﬁc cases if\\ndedicated studies by experts are conducted. In addition, rule-\\nbased NLP approaches are easy to interpret and understand.\\nHowever, rules are normally too limited to cover all cases\\nconsidering the ﬂexibility and complex patterns of human lan-\\nguage. In addition, rule-based NLP requires expertise in both\\ncomputer science and linguistics to design appropriate rules to\\nﬁt human language, hindering it from large-scale applications.\\nCurrently, rule-based approaches have been widely considered\\nobsolete by academia [6], and are occasionally used for better\\npreprocessing nowadays [7].\\nIn general, statistical NLP is superior to rule-based NLP in\\nperformance and robustness. However, it also requires domain\\nexpertise to create handcrafted features, and is therefore lim-\\nited to taking full advantage of available data and providing\\nenough accuracy in complex applications. Although statistical\\nNLP requires intensive feature engineering, it is this direct\\nfeature design that makes it transparent and interpretable as\\nrule-based NLP. In addition, statistical NLP does not rely on\\nlarge-scale datasets or large amounts of computational power,\\nand thus is much more efﬁcient than neural NLP. Furthermore,\\nrepresentative statistical NLP models, such as bag-of-words\\n[8], TF-IDF [9], [10], and n-gram [11]–[13], have different\\ncharacteristics. Bag-of-words is easy to implement, but it\\nonly considers the frequencies of words in a sentence, which\\nneglects the importance and sequential order of these words.'),\n",

N-gram\\nconsiders n −1 words before a word, which makes it more\\naccurate than bag-of-words but with higher computational\\ncomplexity (increases exponentially with n). It is worth men-\\ntioning that despite the dominance of deep learning in recent\\nyears, statistical NLP is still active in many healthcare studies\\nand applications.\\nRecent years have witnessed the success of neural NLP, who\\nhas shown better performance than both rule-based NLP and\\nstatistical NLP in applications with abundant available data.\\nHowever, neural NLP is often blamed for low interpretability\\nand dependence on expensive computing platforms. It is\\nalso worth noting that, compared with rule-based NLP and\\nstatistical NLP, neural NLP usually fails to achieve satisfac-\\ntory performance if limited data is available. Among neural\\nNLP models, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models,\\nespecially long short-term memory (LSTM) [14]–[16]-based\\nmodels and gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based models [15],\\n[17], are more natural for processing sequential data such\\nas text and speech. They have the ability to remember his-\\ntorical information of the inputs, but suffer from gradient\\nvanishing/explosion, training issues and short-term memories.\\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models [18],\\n[19], combining with word embeddings, also show good\\nperformance in some tasks due to their ability in learning\\nlocal features and high computational efﬁciency which enables\\ndeep network architectures. Recently, graph neural network\\n(GNN)-based models have been applied to NLP-driven smart\\nhealthcare by incorporating knowledge from graph-structured\\nontology/entities [20]–[22]. When graphs are large in scale\\nor complex, GNN-based models are difﬁcult and costly to\\nimplement and train. Generally speaking, RNNs, CNNs, and\\nGNNs are all limited in tackling long-term dependencies in se-\\nquences. Through the self-attention mechanism, Transformer-\\nbased models [23], [24] are very efﬁcient in processing\\nlong sequences and support parallel training, but are lack\\nof ability in learning local features and position information.\\nWe have witnessed many combinations of the aforementioned\\nmodels for better feature extraction performance, including\\nCNN-LSTM networks [25], RNN-Attention networks [26],\\n[27], memory networks (MM) [28], [29], graph convolutional\\nnetworks (GCN) [30], CNN-LSTM-Attention networks [31],\\n[32], graph convolutional attention networks (GCAN) [33],\\n[34], etc. In addition, to further leverage large unlabelled\\ncorpora, pretraining, a very effective method, has been widely\\nexploited to obtain non-contextual or contextual embeddings\\n[35]. Word2vec [36]–[39], and GloVe (Global Vectors) [36],\\n[40], as representative algorithms of non-contextual embed-\\ndings, provide distributed dense vectors as word embeddings,\\nand outperform statistical algorithms such as bag-of-words and\\nn-gram. The non-contextual embedding for a word is static\\nand does not dynamically change as its context changes [35].\\nBased on the Transformer architecture, contextual embed-\\ndings, e.g., ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) [41],\\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans-\\nformers) [42]–[45], and GPT (Generative Pre-Training) [46],\\nare developed to embed dynamic contextual information into\\nword embeddings, achieving outstanding performance than\\nother word embedding algorithms. It should be noted that these\\nmodels are typically huge and expensive to pre-train, which\\nsomehow constraints their broad application in healthcare.\\nThe comparisons of different NLP approaches and repre-\\nsentative algorithms are shown in Table I.\\nB. NLP pipeline for smart healthcare\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, there are three parts in an NLP pipeline\\nfor smart healthcare, i.e., preprocessing, feature extraction, and\\nmodelling. An NLP pipeline takes text or speech as illustrated\\nbefore as the input. After that, preprocessing is conducted\\nconsidering various inputs and their qualities to facilitate\\nfeature extraction and modelling. As the most important step,\\nfeature extraction is essential to NLP, which undoubtedly\\nexplains the attention it has received from researchers. Finally,\\nmodels for speciﬁc NLP tasks are built with the extracted\\nfeatures to yield the outputs accordingly.\\n1) Preprocessing: Preprocessing, including the procedures\\nof tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal,\\nand etc., makes natural language normalized, machine-\\nreadable, and easy for postprocessing. Text preprocessing\\nmostly paves the way for feature extraction and modelling,\\nsince many NLP tasks require normalized text input to guar-\\nantee accuracy and efﬁciency due to signiﬁcant challenges\\ncoming from the ﬂexibility of natural languages and the\\nwide variety of morphological variants of medical terms in\\nmedical text [47]–[49]. However, with the development of\\nneural NLP, some text preprocessing procedures have become\\nunnecessary and may even cause problems. For example,\\nremoving stopwords may lead to the loss of informative\\ncontext information when using the BERT pre-trained model\\n[50]. As the preprocessing of speech, such as denoising, is\\ntypically regarded as a problem in signal processing, we do\\nnot discuss it in detail here.\\n2) Feature extraction: Apart from the increase in accessible\\ndigital data and the advances in computing platforms such\\nas graphics processing units, the development of NLP is\\nlargely attributed to the improvement in feature design or\\nfeature extraction methods. Both rule-based approaches and\\nstatistical approaches require expertise for rule design [4],\\n[5] or feature engineering [8]–[13]. For neural NLP, auto-\\nmated feature extraction via varieties of neural networks [14]–\\n[34] have greatly improved the efﬁciency of data utilization\\nand feature extraction. Automated feature engineering can be\\nconducted directly according to the downstream tasks using\\nsupervised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement\\nlearning. In addition, pretraining is also widely used in NLP\\nto automatically extract features from large unlabelled corpora\\nvia self-supervised learning in a generative, contrastive or\\ngenerative-contrastive manner [51] before the downstream\\ntasks begin. The extracted features, known as contextual or\\nnon-contextual embeddings, may encompass features such as\\nlexical meanings, syntactic features, semantic features, and\\neven pragmatics, which contribute to downstream tasks [35].'),\n",

The NLP pipeline for smart healthcare. There are three parts in an NLP pipeline for smart healthcare, i.e., preprocessing, feature extraction, and\\nmodelling. NLP takes text or speech as the input, followed by preprocessing to facilitate feature extraction and modelling. Features can be extracted with\\nvarious methods and models. Models for speciﬁc NLP tasks are ﬁnally built with the extracted features to yield the outputs.\\n3) Modelling: For various smart healthcare applications,\\ndifferent models should be built to accomplish various NLP\\ntasks, such as text classiﬁcation, information extraction, and\\nnatural language understanding. The extracted feature can be\\ndirectly processed by classiﬁers and regressors to yield outputs\\nfor simple tasks, e.g., medical text classiﬁcation [18], [52],\\nwhile further steps are required to complete complex tasks. In\\nthe following subsections, we ﬁrst introduce several text input-\\nbased NLP tasks according to their complexity. At the end of\\nthis section, we will introduce two speech-speciﬁc tasks, i.e.,\\nspeech recognition and speech synthesis.\\nInformation extraction. Information extraction (IE), a.k.a.\\ntext mining, enables harvesting information from text inputs,\\nand plays an important role in text analysis. Works related to\\ninformation extraction in smart healthcare focus on the ex-\\ntraction of diseases, drugs, events (mainly including temporal\\nexpressions, spatial expressions and participant information)\\nthrough name entity recognition [53], [54], relation extraction\\n[54]–[56], and event extraction [57] from medical text, includ-\\ning unstructured text in EHRs, articles, etc.\\nMachine translation. Machine translation (MT) aims to\\nautomatically translate text from one language to another\\n[58]. Currently, healthcare resources in various languages are\\nbecoming easily accessible as technologies evolve, and they\\nare all of great value in modern medical practice. Machine\\ntranslation therefore has drawn growing attention for building\\nbetter (multilingual) translation systems and further leveraging\\nmultilingual healthcare resources for other applications, either\\nto provide more accurate translations [59], [60] or to require\\nless time [60] than human translations.\\nText generation. Text generation (TG) automatically gener-\\nates text with given inputs while pursuing the goal of appearing\\nindistinguishable from human-written text. Speciﬁcally, there\\nare 3 kinds of inputs and corresponding subtasks in smart\\nhealthcare: text inputs (e.g., routine reports) associated with\\ntext summarization [61]–[63], question generation [64]–[66],\\ndialogue generation [67]–[69], and etc.; data inputs (e.g.,\\nneonatal intensive care data) connected with data-to-text [70];\\nand image inputs (e.g., medical images) related to image cap-\\ntioning [71], [72], visual question answering (VQA) [73]–[75],\\nand etc. Note that for data-to-text and image-to-text generation,\\na combination of NLP with data analysis or computer vision\\nis generally required, respectively.\\nInformation retrieval. Information retrieval (IR) obtains\\nmaterials that meet the query requirements from numerous\\ndocuments, and is a core of search engines for all applications.\\nTo ease the retrieval process [76], [77], improve the relevance\\nand diversity of the retrieval [78]–[80] or reduce the query\\ntime [81], current works aim to develop fast and efﬁcient\\ninformation retrieval methods to obtain useful retrieval from a\\nlarge collection of data sources, ranging from internal health\\ninformation system (HIS) systems and other digital documents\\nto online resources.\\nQuestion answering and dialogue systems. Question an-\\nswering (QA) involves automatically providing answers to\\nquestions raised by humans in a natural language. Question\\nanswering requires the machine to understand natural language\\nand infer the answers, making it highly dependent on natural\\nlanguage understanding and information retrieval. To date,\\nQA systems for healthcare have developed from information\\nretrieval based QA systems [82]–[85] and knowledge-based\\nQA systems [86]–[89] to hybrid QA systems [90], [91].\\nCompared to question answering, dialogue is also presented\\nin an interactive manner between humans and machines.\\nCommon dialogue systems in smart healthcare include task-\\noriented dialogue systems [92]–[94], and non-task-oriented\\n(a.k.a. chat-oriented) [95] dialogue systems, which assume\\ndifferent functions in various applications.\\nKnowledge engineering. Knowledge engineering (KE) is\\na ﬁeld within artiﬁcial intelligence that tries to construct and\\nuse knowledge-based systems [96]. It does not refer to a pure\\nNLP technique, but receives much attention in NLP for smart\\nhealthcare since medical text is one of the major sources\\nfor knowledge engineering. Within knowledge engineering,\\nknowledge acquisition and knowledge representation are cou-\\npling with information extraction, aiming at the acquisition\\nand representation of medical knowledge in a certain way,\\ne.g., knowledge graphs [97]–[99]. Besides, knowledge engi-\\nneering also concerns building knowledge-based systems to\\nexploit existing knowledge, such as knowledge-based ques-\\ntion answering (KBQA) systems [86]–[89], knowledge-based\\ninformation retrieval systems [100], text generation systems\\n[65], [101], etc.\\nNatural language understanding. Natural language un-\\nderstanding (NLU) focuses on machines’ comprehension of\\nhuman language in the form of unstructured text or speech.'),\n",

The difﬁculties of natural language understanding\\ncome from the diversity, ambiguity, and potential dependence\\nof natural language, making slow progress in natural language\\nunderstanding compared with other NLP techniques. After\\nyears of development in both general areas and smart health-\\ncare, the mainstream route of NLU is still to use various meth-\\nods to conduct slot ﬁlling and intent detection [102]–[104].\\nNLU is the core of multiple intelligent agents, assuming a\\nrole in understanding human intentions during human-machine\\ninteractions [102], [105], [106], medical queries [103], [104],\\netc.\\nCausal inference. Generally, causal inference is a discipline\\nconcerning the determination of actual effects of speciﬁc\\nthings, events or phenomena. Causal inference in NLP has\\nlong received insufﬁcient attention since the goal of classical\\nNLP applications is simply to make accurate predictions with\\nall available statistical correlations regardless of the underlying\\ncausal relationship [107]. Recently, with growing concerns\\nabout uninterpretable black box models, the importance of\\ncausal inference has gradually been recognized by NLP re-\\nsearchers, especially in the area of healthcare. Speciﬁcally, re-\\ncent advances of causal inference in NLP for smart healthcare\\nhave been made in uncovering causality from medical text\\n[108]–[110] and realizing reliable NLP-driven applications\\nwith discovered causal effects [108]–[110].\\nSpeech recognition and speech synthesis. Speech recogni-\\ntion (SR) aims to convert human speech into text information.\\nContrary to speech recognition, speech synthesis, a.k.a. text-to-\\nspeech (TTS), is concerned with representing text information\\nwith speech. Basically, SR-oriented and SS-oriented studies\\nattempt to build automatic computer systems for interconver-\\nsion between speech and text in the area of smart healthcare,\\nmaking human-machine interaction as natural and ﬂexible as\\nhuman-human interaction [111]. For speech recognition, these\\nefforts encompass the improvement in acoustic modelling\\n[112], [113], language modelling [114], and the whole system\\npipeline [115], [116] to enhance recognition accuracy. For\\nspeech synthesis, recent advancements have been made in\\ninvestigating and making synthesized speech natural [117],\\n[118], intelligible [119]–[123] and expressive [124]–[126],\\nwhich will help stimulate the enthusiasm of human-machine\\ninteraction [127].\\nIII. APPLICATIONS OF NLP FOR SMART HEALTHCARE\\nNLP has been widely applied in smart healthcare and\\nhas brought dramatic improvements in many applications. As\\nshown in Fig. 3, a typical NLP-driven application is composed\\nof two parts: user interface (UI) and backend. The user\\nprovides text or speech input to the backend through the UI,\\nand then, the backend processes these inputs with the NLP\\nmodels and feeds the results back to the user by providing\\nspeciﬁc services through the UI. Knowledge bases are also\\nrequired at the backend for applications that essentially rely on\\nknowledge, for example, the aforementioned KBQA systems.\\nThe NLP techniques described in the previous section play a\\nkey role in both UI and backend.\\ntext\\nspeech\\nspeech\\nrecognition\\nmachine\\ntranslation\\nBackend\\nUser Interfaces\\nUser\\nSupporting \\nModels\\nKnowledge \\nBases\\nServices\\nInputs\\nFig. 3.\\nBasic architecture of NLP-driven applications. A typical NLP-\\ndriven application is composed of user interface and backend, where the UI\\ntakes inputs from the user and feedback the results to the user, and the backend\\nprocesses these inputs with the NLP models with or without the knowledge\\nbases according to the speciﬁc task type.\\nThe UI enables information exchange between users and\\nintelligent systems through speech, text, etc. Easily accessible\\nUIs are critical for enhancing the experience of using intelli-\\ngent systems and realizing smart healthcare. Such user inter-\\nfaces can be implemented by using NLP techniques, especially\\nspeech recognition and natural language understanding.\\nAccording to their application scenarios, smart healthcare\\napplications employing NLP techniques can be classiﬁed into\\n5 major categories, i.e., clinical practice, hospital manage-\\nment, personal care, public health, and drug development. A\\nsummary of the applications and related NLP techniques is\\npresented in Table II. Below we introduce the ﬁve categories\\nin detail.\\nA. Clinical practice\\nClinical communication and data collection. Clinical\\ndata, including but not limited to demographics, medical\\nhistory, comorbidities, medical notes, physical examination\\nnotes, electronic recordings from medical devices, and clinical\\nlaboratory testing data and medical images [128], are the most\\nimportant data for diagnosis, treatment and even further retro-\\nspection. Patient-provider communication is an important way\\nto obtain ﬁrst-hand clinical data. When necessary, machine\\ntranslation may assist doctors in communicating with patients\\nwho speak different languages or have low literacy and limited\\nlevels of health education [129], [130]. Meanwhile, free text\\nnotes can be taken through speech recognition [131]–[133],\\nwhich can signiﬁcantly reduce medical staff’s time on labour-\\nintensive clinical documentation.'),\n",

Clinical decision support (CDS)\\nsystems can provide physicians with diagnosis and treatment\\nsuggestions, which play an increasingly important role in\\nclinical medicine with the surge of clinical cases and growing\\nconcerns regarding public healthcare. With the development of\\nquestion answering systems, clinical decision support based\\non question answering [84], [134], [135] has emerged and\\nbecome common, as it is closer to traditional patient-provider\\ncommunication. NLP techniques have shown great ability to\\nbuild clinical decision support systems by extracting various\\nuseful information for making diagnosis and therapeutic de-\\ncisions, such as family history information [136], entities and\\nrelations [137], [138], treatment and prognosis data [139],\\nclinical data concepts and features [140], and even causal\\nrelations [109], [110]. In addition, to ensure quality control\\nand future quality improvement, NLP can also contribute to\\nthe assessment of clinical procedures [141], [142], warning\\nof potentially harmful adverse drug events (ADEs) [143],\\ndisease symptoms [144], [145], and outcome-related causal\\neffects [146]. Finally, NLP is also powerful in enhancing\\nthe interpretability and reliability of clinical decision support\\nsystems for practical deployment, by providing supporting\\nevidence for diagnosis or treatment decisions in an evidence-\\nbased fashion [108], [147]–[150].\\nB. Hospital management\\nMedical resource allocation. Due to limited medical re-\\nsources, including hospital spaces, personnel, and materi-\\nals, efﬁcient resource allocation is critical in hospitals and\\nother medical facilities. By building patient triage systems,\\nmedical resources can attend to critical cases with priority\\nand enhance medical resource allocation effectiveness and\\nefﬁciency [151], [152]. Virtual assistants [153]–[155], hospital\\nautomation systems [156], [157] and collaborative robots\\n[158], [159] with voice control can further reduce the burden\\non medical staff, thereby improving hospital management\\nefﬁciency. There are also some interesting works that have\\nexplored the prediction of patient readmission to rearrange\\nmedical resources/interventions and reduce the readmission\\nrate [160]–[162]. In addition, by leveraging text generation\\ntechniques, part of text writing in healthcare, especially routine\\nreports, can be taken over by machines, freeing medical staff\\nfrom many administrative duties and making them available\\nfor direct patient care [70], [163].\\nData management. To manage large volumes of medical\\ndocumentation, text classiﬁcation, information extraction and\\ntext summarization can be used to generate category labels,\\ninformative keywords and simpliﬁed summaries [18], [52],\\n[62], [63], [164] for management, while information retrieval\\nsystems, especially those systems based on semantic search\\n[76], [165] and question answering [77], can be used in\\nhealthcare information systems to ease the retrieval process.\\nService quality control. Sentiment analysis with patient\\nexperience feedback will help hospitals improve their service\\nquality and patient experience. Such analysis required sub-\\nstantial personnel resources in the past, while NLP makes this\\nwork easier and greatly improves the efﬁciency of sentiment\\nanalysis [166]–[168].\\nC. Personal care\\nPersonal health assistants. Personal health assistants en-\\nable people to easily access useful medical information and\\nhealthcare services without visiting the healthcare institutions.\\nPersonal health assistants may incorporate several subsystems,\\nsuch as medical information access systems [169] and remote\\nhealthcare systems [170], for various purposes.\\nAssisting elderly individuals and disabled individuals.\\nNLP techniques can help elderly individuals and disabled\\nindividuals to greatly enhance their quality of life and so-\\ncial integration. Voice-controlled home automation systems\\nand robots may assist the elderly and the disabled in their\\ndaily lives [171], while robots (especially androids and other\\nrobots that communicate with people) can even encourage and\\naccompany them through social interactions [172], [173]. In\\naddition, NLP techniques are also of great value for providing\\nessential aids to people with various disabilities, e.g., speech\\nimpairments [122], [174]–[178], hearing loss [179], dyslexia\\n[180], or neurological disorders [119]–[121].\\nD. Public health\\nHealth knowledge popularization and medical educa-\\ntion. Health knowledge popularization and medical education\\nare essential public health interventions since they can im-\\nprove people’s health literacy and help them develop healthy\\nliving habits. Through knowledge engineering, accurate and\\ncomplete medical knowledge bases can be established to\\npromote the popularization of medical knowledge among the\\npopulation [86]–[89], [97]–[100], [181]. Speciﬁcally, people\\ncan easily access medical knowledge through question an-\\nswering systems [182], [183], information retrieval systems\\n[79], [81], and machine translation systems [1], [130], [184],\\n[185], facilitating the popularization and education of medical\\nknowledge. In addition, text generation techniques, such as\\nquestion generation and text summarization, can also be used\\nin medical education to generate medical case-based questions\\n[186] and construct simpliﬁed summaries [61].\\nPopulation screening. In addition to the health knowledge\\npopularization, population screening, which refers to the pro-\\ncess of assessing the prevalence of a disease or condition in\\na population or subgroup, is also an important intervention\\nfor delivering public health. The population screening starts\\nwith identifying target populations, followed by the screening\\ntest. After that, further actions such as further tests, advice, or\\ntreatment can be taken considering the screening results [187].\\nNLP can play two main roles in population screening. First,\\nNLP helps identify populations with higher health risk factors,\\nwhich may improve the efﬁciency of population screening\\n[188]. Second, NLP can also assist in the analysis of healthcare\\nquestionnaires and surveys [189], especially for open-ended\\nquestions.\\nE. Drug development\\nDrug discovery. NLP helps construct textual representa-\\ntions of biochemical entities for mapping the interactions'),\n",

NLP techniques, especially informa-\\ntion extraction, are also able to identify the relations between\\nchemical structures and biological activity [191] and further\\nhelp researchers search for potentially effective chemical com-\\npounds, i.e., virtual screening [192], [193], in a huge chemical\\nspace. In addition, they are also applied in the prediction\\nof adverse drug reactions, including side effect prediction\\n[194], toxicity prediction [195], [196], and etc., in preclinical\\nresearch.\\nClinical research.

Recently, the FDA\\nand other institutions have reported being interested in using\\nNLP for adverse drug event discovery and drug safety moni-\\ntoring [201]–[203], showing the full range of NLP’s key role\\nin drug development.\\nIV. NLP-DRIVEN SMART HEALTHCARE FOR SPECIFIC\\nMEDICAL ISSUES\\nNLP-driven smart healthcare plays an important role in\\nmany medical issues. In this section, we discuss how NLP-\\ndriven smart healthcare works in medical issues by taking two\\nspeciﬁc medical issues, i.e., COVID-19 pandemic and mental\\nhealth, as examples.\\nA. COVID-19 pandemic\\nWorldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has triggered an unprece-\\ndented global health crisis and has attracted much attention\\nfrom researchers [204]. No wonder, the COVID-19 pandemic\\nhas become one of the most inﬂuential medical issues over\\nthe past few years. In the COVID-19 pandemic, NLP-driven\\nsmart healthcare can be utilized for pandemic prevention,\\ndiagnosing, and drug development.\\nEarly forecasts of COVID-19 cases and pandemic knowl-\\nedge popularization are crucial to the prevention of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. In [205], an NLP module is embedded\\ninto an improved susceptible–infected model to build the\\nproposed hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction, showing\\nthat the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 cases can be im-\\nproved by incorporating text inputs and with NLP techniques.\\nIn [206], the authors conclude that NLP techniques, e.g.,\\nNLP-aided information retrieval, literature-based discovery,\\nquestion answering and etc., can be applied to address the\\ninformation/knowledge needs of both researchers and the\\npublic in the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nIn clinical practice, NLP can be utilized to identify posi-\\ntively diagnosed COVID19 patients from free text narratives\\n[207], assess thoracic CT imaging reports [208], and identify\\nindividuals with the greatest risk of severe complications due\\nto COVID-19 [209], and provide COVID-19 testing advice\\n[210]. Such applications would be very useful to accelerate\\nthe diagnosis of COVID-19, mitigate its worst effects, and\\nalso reduce costs for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nNLP has also been applied to drug development confronting\\nCOVID-19. In [211], the authors developed an NLP method\\nto automatically recognize the associations among potential\\ntargeted host organ systems, associated clinical manifestations\\nand pathways, and suggest potential drug candidates. NLP\\nmodels have also made great impacts in COVID-19 vaccine\\ndiscovery through protein interaction prediction, molecular\\nreaction modelling [212]. In addition, great opportunities\\nfor NLP can also be found in clinical design, regulatory\\ndecision-making, and pharmacovigilance [213]. These appli-\\ncations would signiﬁcantly reduce the time and cost of drug\\ndevelopment for COVID-19.\\nB. Mental health\\nThe mental health issues have received widespread and\\ncontinuously increasing attention for many years. Specially,\\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) claimed that the pan-\\ndemic and the resulting lockdowns, economic security, fear\\nand uncertainty would further cause devastating impacts on\\npeople’s mental health the world over in the past several\\nyears [214]. NLP-driven smart healthcare has great value in\\npredicting/diagnosing and treating mental health conditions.\\nNLP techniques have been applied to early predict or\\nidentify/screen various mental disorders, such as psychiatric\\nillness [215], late-life depression [216], severe mental illness\\n(schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder)\\n[217]. In addition, some works have shown that NLP tech-\\nniques can predict risk-taking behaviours (e.g., suicide) with\\ngood discrimination [218], [219] so that early interventions\\ncan be taken to save lives. The data collected for such\\nanalysis may include text data such as social media posts,\\nscreening surveys, EHRs [220], and also speech data come\\nfrom narrative interviews [221], etc.\\nNLP techniques could also (automatically) provide effective\\npsychotherapeutic interventions through web-based psycho-\\neducational interventions, online counseling, etc., to augment\\ntherapist-based mental health interventions, showing potential\\nfuture opportunities for their integration into online men-\\ntal health tools [222]. For example, the insights of [223]\\ncould help improve counselor training and generate real-time\\ncounseling quality monitoring and answer suggestion support\\ntools. In addition, several mental health related areas that may\\nbeneﬁt from NLP techniques, including characterizing and\\nunderstanding mental disorders, measuring health outcomes,\\nstudying of social and occupational functioning, etc, were\\nshown in [219]. Speciﬁcally, [224] showed that the older\\nwould respond better to digital assistants employing a socially-\\noriented interaction style rather than the one with a task-\\noriented style, which is promising to promote mental health\\nin older adults by providing social interaction and company.\\nV. LIMITATIONS AND OUTLOOK\\nAlthough recent advancements in deep learning and neural\\nNLP have brought extraordinary enhancement to smart health-\\ncare, there are still some limitations that current methods have\\nyet to overcome.'),\n",

Although substantial\\nefforts have been made to enable natural language understand-\\ning, the ﬂexibility of human language still makes full under-\\nstanding difﬁcult, especially when ambiguity in biomedical\\ntexts is encountered. Misunderstanding could lead to inaccu-\\nrate actions taken by robots, useless information returned by\\nengines, and even wrong decisions made by decision support\\nsystems, leading to economic loss, time wasting, and even\\nmore serious consequences.\\nInterpretability. Although applications that rely on neural\\nNLP to extract features and make decisions show excellent\\nperformance in real tasks, they are usually challenged by\\nusers due to their weakness in interpretability. Interpretability\\nis essential for smart healthcare applications, especially in\\nclinical scenarios that require quality assurance in cases of\\nlow conﬁdence. One of the major interpretability issues is\\nthat the learned features are usually not understood by hu-\\nmans. In addition, when tuning pre-trained language models\\nto downstream tasks, no enough intuitions on data for ﬁne-\\ntuning or types of applications can be given to guarantee good\\nperformance. Although efforts have been made to achieve\\ninterpretable NLP-driven applications, existing theories and\\nmethodologies are still not convincing and acceptable for\\nmany healthcare researchers and institutions. Before the inter-\\npretability issue is fully explored, the role of decision support\\nsystems in clinical practice can only be auxiliary from the\\nperspectives of medical ethics and practical application.\\nImplementation. There are still many issues concerning the\\nimplementation of NLP-driven applications in smart health-\\ncare. With the development of neural NLP, large deep neu-\\nral networks (e.g., pre-trained language models) have been\\nquickly migrated to smart healthcare. What followed are the\\nincreased requirements in computing power and training cost,\\nand the concerns about the reliability of neural NLP systems.\\nPatient privacy also prevents these models from achieving\\nmore prominent effects in smart healthcare for further practice.\\nThe consideration of medical ethics when applying such\\nsystems makes practical implementation more difﬁcult.'),\n",

One direction to\\nenhance existing NLP systems can be the combination of\\nmultiple NLP techniques. For example, text generation can\\nwork as a data augmentation method for achieving comparable\\nresults in many applications with limited original data, such\\nas training QA systems [65], [85] and other clinically relevant\\ntasks [225], [226]. Through automatic question generation,\\nquestionnaires and surveys for population screening can be\\ngenerated from EHRs, which may outperform handcrafted\\nones. Machine translation has also proven beneﬁcial for var-\\nious text-based tasks by increasing the availability of mul-\\ntilingual healthcare information [227]–[229], implying the\\npossibility of improving the performance of current CDS\\nsystems. In addition, exploration of general knowledge and\\ndomain knowledge in the ﬁeld of NLP for smart healthcare\\ndeserves further attention and veriﬁcation.\\nEnd-to-end applications. Current NLP driven applications\\nfor smart healthcare usually focus on dealing with tasks step\\nby step and do not fully explore the feature extraction capa-\\nbility of advanced neural NLP for complex smart healthcare\\ntasks. A deeper integration of NLP techniques and healthcare\\napplications in an end-to-end manner can map the inputs\\nand outputs directly, signiﬁcantly simplify traditional pipelines\\nfor complex applications, eliminate the biases of intermediate\\ncomponents, and therefore achieve better performance. Taking\\npopulation screening as an example, although NLP has been\\napplied to identify populations and analyse screening test\\nresults in traditional screening procedures, NLP techniques can\\nbe further applied to build end-to-end population screening\\nsystems, with which the correlations between populations\\nand optimal actions can be found to improve the screening\\nperformance and the quality of healthcare. Another example\\nwould be reducing the readmission rate. As mentioned before,\\nsome works have revealed that NLP has the ability to predict\\npatient readmission, but further studies on providing appropri-\\nate interventions to reduce the readmission rate are not fully\\nconducted. We look forward to studies that integrate the two\\nparts to reveal every possibility for readmission rate reducing.\\nFew-shot learning and incorporating domain knowledge.\\nBy exploiting the learning capability of neural networks and\\nlarge available corpora, neural NLP has shown powerful ability\\nin learning language representations. However, for downstream\\ntasks or smart healthcare applications, there is still a long\\nway for NLP to go. Taking clinical decision support as an\\nexample, there are a lot of rare diseases with only a small\\nnumber of observations available for training a clinical deci-\\nsion support system to distinguish rare diseases from common\\ndiseases. This is a quite challenging task, especially when\\nthere are similar outcomes among some rare diseases and\\ncommon diseases. In addition, high-quality labelled data are\\nundoubtedly essential to guarantee task accuracy in developing\\npractical applications for smart healthcare. However, quality-\\ncontrolled annotation not only requires a large amount of\\ncost, but is also challenging due to the bias of experts’ level\\nof expertise. Therefore, even with well-learned pre-trained\\nlanguage models, few-shot learning algorithms and domain\\nknowledge are expected to be applied so that the ﬁne-tuned\\nmodels would be effective in learning from few rare disease\\nobservations or limited high-quality labelled data.\\nIncorporating multimodal and longitudinal data. Finally,\\nwe also anticipate future intelligent systems to utilize all avail-\\nable AI techniques, not only NLP, for practical applications\\nwith high accuracy and reliability. The past few years have\\nwitnessed the dominance of data-driven approaches in many\\napplications across various ﬁelds. NLP, computer vision, and\\nother machine learning algorithms can be applied to analyse\\nmedical text, medical images, electronic recordings (e.g., heart\\nsound), sensors data, laboratory results, and even genetic\\ninformation. With multimodal learning, useful information\\nextracted from these modalities can be combined together to\\nperfectly ﬁt the need for a complete and accurate analysis\\nof available healthcare data and patients’ health status. In\\naddition, all of these data and clinical events can be longi-\\ntudinal, where time series analysis can be applied to extract\\nlong-term dependencies and improve health care delivery. By\\ncombining these techniques to analyse multimodal and lon-\\ngitudinal data, future intelligent systems would become more\\npowerful and reliable for patients, physicians, and healthcare\\ninstitutions for applications such as 24/7 health monitoring,\\nchronic-condition management, healthy lifestyle promotion,\\nand precision medicine.\\nVI. CONCLUSION\\nIn the context of smart healthcare, NLP takes text or speech\\nas the input in various scenarios involving humans and ma-\\nchines, and realizes the functions of analysing and understand-\\ning human language. In this paper, we review existing studies\\nconcerning NLP for smart healthcare from the perspectives\\nof technique and application. We elaborate on different NLP\\napproaches and the NLP pipeline for smart healthcare from the\\ntechnical point of view. Table I provides the comparisons of\\ndifferent NLP approaches and their representative algorithms.\\nVarious text-oriented and speech-oriented NLP tasks are elab-\\norated to conclude existing methodologies for tackling such\\ntasks. By introducing smart healthcare applications employing\\nNLP techniques in various smart healthcare scenarios (in-\\ncluding clinical practice, hospital management, personal care,\\npublic health, and drug development), we show the strength\\nand possibility of NLP for delivering smart healthcare. Table II\\nprovides a detailed list of representative applications in smart\\nhealthcare and their related NLP techniques. We further dis-\\ncuss two speciﬁc medical issues, i.e., COVID-19 pandemic and\\nmental health, in which NLP-driven smart healthcare plays an\\nimportant role. After that, we discuss the limitations of current\\nworks across understanding human language, interpretability,\\nand implementation of NLP systems for smart healthcare.\\nFinally, we identify several directions for future works, notably\\ncombining multiple NLP techniques, developing end-to-end\\napplications, few-shot learning, and incorporating multimodal\\nand longitudinal data.'),\n",

Leveraging the Qwen3 LLMs’ robust\\ncapabilities in multilingual text understanding and generation, our innovative multi-\\nstage training pipeline combines large-scale unsupervised pre-training with supervised\\nfine-tuning on high-quality datasets. Effective model merging strategies further ensure\\nthe robustness and adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training\\nprocess, the Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role\\nin synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple domains\\nand languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3 Embedding series\\noffers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both embedding and reranking tasks,\\naddressing diverse deployment scenarios where users can optimize for either efficiency\\nor effectiveness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series\\nachieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the\\nmultilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in various\\nretrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and multilingual retrieval.\\nTo facilitate reproducibility and promote community-driven research and development,\\nthe Qwen3 Embedding models are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nText embedding and reranking are fundamental components in numerous natural language pro-\\ncessing and information retrieval applications, including web search, question answering, recom-\\nmendation systems, and beyond (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023; 2024).\\nHigh-quality embeddings enable models to capture semantic relationships between texts, while\\neffective reranking mechanisms ensure that the most relevant results are prioritized. Recently,\\nemerging application paradigms such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent sys-\\ntems, driven by the advancement of large language models (e.g., Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025), GPT-4o\\n(Hurst et al., 2024)), have introduced new requirements and challenges for text embedding and\\nreranking, both in terms of model training paradigms and application scenarios. Despite significant\\nadvancements, training embedding and reranking models that perform well in scalability, contextual\\nunderstanding, and alignment with specific downstream tasks remains challenging.\\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the development of text\\nembedding and reranking models.

Additionally, there has been considerable research facilitating the integration of LLMs\\ninto processes such as training data synthesis and quality data filtering (Wang et al., 2024; Lee et al.,\\n2024; 2025b). The fundamental characteristics of LLMs have also inspired the introduction of new\\ntraining paradigms. For instance, during the embedding model training process, incorporating\\ndifferentiated tasks across aspects such as instruction type, domain, and language has yielded\\nimproved performance in downstream tasks (Su et al., 2023). Similarly, for reranking model training,\\nadvancements have been realized through both zero-shot methods based on user prompts and\\napproaches combining supervised fine-tuning (Ma et al., 2023; Pradeep et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,\\n2024a; Zhuang et al., 2024).\\nIn this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series models, which are constructed on top\\nof the Qwen3 foundation models. The Qwen3 foundation has simultaneously released base and\\ninstruct model versions, and we exploit the robust multilingual text understanding and generation\\ncapabilities of these models to fully realize their potential in training embedding and reranking\\nmodels. To train the embedding models, we implement a multi-stage training pipeline that involves\\nlarge-scale unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine tuning on high-quality datasets.\\nWe also employ model merging with various model checkpoints to enhance robustness and general-\\nization. The Qwen3 instruct model allows for efficient synthesis of a vast, high-quality, multilingual,\\nand multi-task text relevance dataset. This synthetic data is utilized in the initial unsupervised\\ntraining stage, while a subset of high-quality, small-scale data is selected for the second stage of\\nsupervised training. For the reranking models, we adopt a two-stage training scheme in a similar\\nmanner, consisting of high-quality supervised fine tuning and a model merging stage. Based on\\ndifferent sizes of the Qwen3 backbone models (including 0.6B, 4B, and 8B), we ultimately trained\\nthree text embedding models and three text reranking models. To facilitate their application in\\ndownstream tasks, the Qwen3 Embedding series supports several practical features, such as flexible\\ndimension representation for embedding models and customizable instructions for both embedding\\nand reranking models.\\nWe evaluate the Qwen3 Embedding series across a comprehensive set of benchmarks spanning\\nmultiple tasks and domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our embedding and reranking\\nmodels achieve state-of-the-art performance, performing competitively against leading proprietary\\nmodels in several retrieval tasks. For example, the flagship model Qwen3-8B-Embedding attains a\\nscore of 70.58 on the MTEB Multilingual benchmark (Enevoldsen et al., 2025) and 80.68 on the MTEB\\nCode benchmark (Enevoldsen et al., 2025), surpassing the previous state-of-the-art proprietary\\nembedding model, Gemini-Embedding (Lee et al., 2025b). Moreover, our reranking model delivers\\ncompetitive results across a range of retrieval tasks. The Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B model exceeds\\npreviously top-performing models in numerous retrieval tasks, while the larger Qwen3-Reranker-8B\\nmodel demonstrates even superior performance, improving ranking results by 3.0 points over the\\n0.6B model across multiple tasks. Furthermore, we include a constructive ablation study to elucidate\\nthe key factors contributing to the superior performance of the Qwen3 Embedding series, providing\\ninsights into its effectiveness.\\nIn the following sections, we describe the design of the model architecture, detail the training\\nprocedures, present the experimental results for both the embedding and reranking models of the\\nQwen3 Embedding Series, and conclude this technical report by summarizing the key findings and\\noutlining potential directions for future research.\\n2\\nModel Architecture\\nThe core idea behind embedding and reranking models is to evaluate relevance in a task-aware\\nmanner. Given a query q and a document d, embedding and reranking models assess their relevance\\nbased on a similarity criterion defined by instruction I. To enable the models for task-aware rele-\\nvance estimation, training data is often organized as {Ii, qi, d+\\ni , d−\\ni,1, · · · , d−\\ni,n}, where d+\\ni represents a\\n2'),\n",

The label l is “yes” for positive documents\\nand “no” for negatives. This loss function encourages the model to assign higher probabilities to\\ncorrect labels, thereby improving the ranking performance.\\n3.2\\nMulti-stage Training\\nThe multi-stage training approach is a common practice for training text embedding models (Li et al.,\\n2023; Wang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024). This strategy typically begins with initial training on large-\\nscale, semi-supervised data that includes noise, followed by fine-tuning using smaller, high-quality\\nsupervised datasets. This two-step process enhances the performance and generalization capabilities\\nof embedding models. Large-scale weakly supervised training data contribute significantly to\\nthe model’s generalization, while fine-tuning with high-quality data in subsequent stages further\\nimproves model performance. Both stages of training for embedding models utilize the optimization\\nobjective defined in Equation 1, whereas the reranking model training employs the loss function\\ndefined in Equation 2 as the optimization target.\\nBuilding upon the existing multi-stage training framework, the Qwen3 Embedding series introduces\\nthe following key innovations:\\n• Large-Scale Synthetic Data-Driven Weak Supervision Training: Unlike previous works (e.g.,\\nGTE, E5, BGE models), where weakly supervised training data are primarily collected from\\nopen-source communities such as Q&A forums or academic papers, we propose leveraging\\nthe text understanding and generation capabilities of foundation models to synthesize pair\\ndata directly. This approach allows for arbitrary definition of various dimensions of the\\ndesired pair data, such as task, language, length, and difficulty within the synthesis prompts.\\nCompared to data collection from open-domain sources, foundation model-driven data\\nsynthesis offers greater controllability, enabling precise management of the quality and\\ndiversity of the generated data, particularly in low-resource scenarios and languages.\\n• High-Quality Synthetic Data Utilization in Supervised Fine Tuning: Due to the exceptional\\nperformance of the Qwen3 Foundation model, the synthesized data is of notably high quality.\\nTherefore, in the second stage of supervised training, selective incorporation of this high-\\nquality synthetic data further enhances the overall model performance and generalization\\ncapabilities.\\n• Model Merging: Inspired by previous work (Li et al., 2024), after completing the supervised\\nfine-tuning, we applied a model merging technique based on spherical linear interpolation\\n(slerp). This technique involves merging multiple model checkpoints saved during the\\nfine-tuning process. This step aims to boost the model’s robustness and generalization\\nperformance across various data distributions.\\nIt is important to note that the reranking model’s training process does not include a first-stage\\nweakly supervised training phase.\\n5'),\n",

The quality of these synthetic data pairs is ensured by utilizing the Qwen3-\\n32B model as the foundational model for data synthesis. We have designed a diverse prompting\\nstrategy to improve the variety and authenticity of the generated data. For instance, in the text\\nretrieval task, we synthesize data using the multilingual pre-training corpus from Qwen3. During\\nthe data synthesis process, specific roles are assigned to each document to simulate potential\\nusers querying that document. This injection of user perspectives enhances the diversity and\\nrealism of the synthetic queries. Specifically, we utilize a retrieval model to identify the top five\\nrole candidates for each document from a role library and present these documents along with\\ntheir role candidates to the prompt. This guides the model in outputting the most suitable role\\nconfiguration for query generation. Moreover, the prompt incorporates various dimensions such as\\nquery type (e.g., keyword, factual, summary, judgment), query length, difficulty, and language. This\\nmultidimensional approach ensures the quality and diversity of the synthetic data.\\nFinally, we create a total of approximately 150 million pairs of multi-task weak supervision training\\ndata. Our experiments reveal that the embedding model trained with these synthetic data performs\\nexceptionally well in downstream evaluations, particularly surpassing many previously supervised\\nmodels in the MTEB Multilingual benchmarks. This motivates us to filter the synthetic data to\\nidentify high-quality pairs for inclusion in a second stage of supervised training. We employ a\\nsimple cosine similarity calculation to select data pairs, retaining those with a cosine similarity\\ngreater than 0.7 from randomly sampled data.

We\\nutilize the Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model to retrieve the top-100 candidates and then apply different\\nreranking models for further refinement. This approach ensures a fair evaluation of the reranking\\nmodels. Our results indicate that all three Qwen3-Reranker models enhance performance compared\\nto the embedding model and surpass all baseline reranking methods, with Qwen3-Reranker-8B\\nachieving the highest performance across most tasks.\\n4.3\\nAnalysis\\nTo further analyze and explore the key elements of the Qwen3 Embedding model training framework,\\nwe conduct an analysis from the following dimensions:\\nEffectiveness of Large-Scale Weakly Supervised Pre-Training We first analyze the effectiveness\\nof the large-scale weak supervised training stage for the embedding models. As shown in Table 5,\\nthe Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model trained solely on synthetic data (without subsequent training\\nstages, as indicated in the first row) achieves reasonable and strong performance compared to the\\nfinal Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model (as shown in the last row). If we further remove the weak\\nsupervised training stage (i.e., without synthetic data training, as seen in the second row), the final\\nperformance shows a clear decline. This indicates that the large-scale weak supervised training\\nstage is crucial for achieving superior performance.\\nEffectiveness of Model Merging Next, we compare the performance differences arising from the\\nmodel merging stage. As shown in Table 5, the model trained without model merging techniques\\n(the third row, which uses data sampling to balance various tasks) performs considerably worse\\nthan the final Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model (which employs model merging, as shown in the last\\nrow). This indicates that the model merging stage is also critical for developing strong models.\\n8'),\n",

These models are\\ndesigned to excel in a wide range of text embedding and reranking tasks, including multilingual\\nretrieval, code retrieval, and complex instruction following. The Qwen3-Embedding models are\\nbuilt upon a robust multi-stage training pipeline that combines large-scale weakly supervised\\npre-training on synthetic data with supervised fine-tuning and model merging on high-quality\\ndatasets. The Qwen3 LLMs play a crucial role in synthesizing diverse training data across multiple\\nlanguages and tasks, thereby enhancing the models’ capabilities. Our comprehensive evaluations\\ndemonstrate that the Qwen3-Embedding models achieve state-of-the-art performance across various\\nbenchmarks, including MTEB, CMTEB, MMTEB, and several retrieval benchmarks. We are pleased\\nto open-source the Qwen3-Embedding and Qwen3-Reranker models (0.6B, 4B, and 8B), making\\nthem available for the community to use and build upon.\\nReferences\\nJianlyu Chen, Shitao Xiao, Peitian Zhang, Kun Luo, Defu Lian, and Zheng Liu.

To ensure\\nboth multilingual and cross-lingual diversity, the data is generated using Qwen3 32B. Below is an\\nexample of a synthetic retrieval text pair. The retrieval data is synthesized using a document-to-\\nquery approach. We collect a multilingual corpus from the pre-training corpus of the Qwen3 base\\nmodel to serve as the document source. A two-stage generation pipeline is then applied, consisting\\nof: (1) configuration and (2) query generation. In the configuration stage, we use large language\\nmodels (LLMs) to determine the “Question Type”, “Difficulty”, and “Character” for the synthetic\\nquery. The candidate characters are retrieved from Persona Hub (Ge et al., 2024), selecting the top\\nfive most relevant to the given document. This step aims to enhance the diversity of the generated\\nqueries. The template used is as follows:\\nGiven a **Passage** and **Character**, select the appropriate option from\\nthree fields: Character, Question_Type, Difficulty, and return the output\\nin JSON format.\\n,→\\n,→\\nFirst, select the Character who are likely to be interested in the Passage\\nfrom the candidates. Then select the Question_Type that the Character\\nmight ask about the Passage; Finally, choose the Difficulty of the\\npossible question based on the Passage, the Character, and the\\nQuestion_Type.\\n,→\\n,→\\n,→\\n,→\\nCharacter: Given by input **Character**\\nQuestion_Type:\\n- keywords: ...\\n- acquire_knowledge: ...\\n- summary: ...\\n- yes_or_no: ...\\n- background: ...\\nDifficulty:\\n- high_school: ...\\n- university: ...\\n- phd: ...\\nHere are some examples\\n<Example1> <Example2> <Example3>\\nNow, generate the **output** based on the **Passage** and **Character** from\\nuser, the **Passage** will be in {language} language and the **Character**\\nwill be in English.\\n,→\\n,→\\nEnsure to generate only the JSON output with content in English.\\n**Passage**:\\n{passage}\\n**Character**:\\n{character}\\nIn the query generation stage, we use the configuration selected in the first stage to guide the\\ngeneration of queries.

A representative instance of the RAG process applied to question answering. It mainly consists of 3 steps. 1) Indexing. Documents are split into chunks,\\nencoded into vectors, and stored in a vector database. 2) Retrieval. Retrieve the Top k chunks most relevant to the question based on semantic similarity. 3)\\nGeneration. Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows\\na traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and\\ngeneration, which is also characterized as a “Retrieve-Read”\\nframework [7].\\nIndexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data\\nin diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown,\\nwhich is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To\\naccommodate the context limitations of language models, text\\nis segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then\\nencoded into vector representations using an embedding model\\nand stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling\\nefficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\\nRetrieval. Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system\\nemploys the same encoding model utilized during the indexing\\nphase to transform the query into a vector representation.\\nIt then computes the similarity scores between the query\\nvector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus.\\nThe system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that\\ndemonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks\\nare subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\\nGeneration. The posed query and selected documents are\\nsynthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language\\nmodel is tasked with formulating a response. The model’s\\napproach to answering may vary depending on task-specific\\ncriteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric\\nknowledge or restrict its responses to the information con-\\ntained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing\\ndialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated\\ninto the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn\\ndialogue interactions effectively.\\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:\\nRetrieval Challenges. The retrieval phase often struggles\\nwith precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned\\nor irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\\nGeneration Difficulties. In generating responses, the model\\nmay face the issue of hallucination, where it produces con-\\ntent not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can\\nalso suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs,\\ndetracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\\nAugmentation Hurdles. Integrating retrieved information\\nwith the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting\\nin disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also\\nencounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved\\nfrom multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Deter-\\nmining the significance and relevance of various passages and\\nensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity.\\nFacing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original\\nquery may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\\nMoreover, there’s a concern that generation models might\\noverly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that\\nsimply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or\\nsynthesized information.\\nB. Advanced RAG\\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to over-\\ncome the limitations of Naive RAG. Focusing on enhancing re-\\ntrieval quality, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strate-\\ngies. To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines\\nits indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window\\napproach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of\\nmetadata. Additionally, it incorporates several optimization\\nmethods to streamline the retrieval process [8].'),\n",

(Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle)\\nAdvanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a\\nchain-like structure. (Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall. This is evident in the\\nintroduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules. The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and\\ngeneration; it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval.\\nPre-retrieval process. In this stage, the primary focus is\\non optimizing the indexing structure and the original query.\\nThe goal of optimizing indexing is to enhance the quality of\\nthe content being indexed. This involves strategies: enhancing\\ndata granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata,\\nalignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. While the goal\\nof query optimization is to make the user’s original question\\nclearer and more suitable for the retrieval task. Common\\nmethods include query rewriting query transformation, query\\nexpansion and other techniques [7], [9]–[11].\\nPost-Retrieval Process. Once relevant context is retrieved,\\nit’s crucial to integrate it effectively with the query. The main\\nmethods in post-retrieval process include rerank chunks and\\ncontext compressing. Re-ranking the retrieved information to\\nrelocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt is\\na key strategy. This concept has been implemented in frame-\\nworks such as LlamaIndex2, LangChain3, and HayStack [12].\\nFeeding all relevant documents directly into LLMs can lead\\nto information overload, diluting the focus on key details with\\nirrelevant content.To mitigate this, post-retrieval efforts con-\\ncentrate on selecting the essential information, emphasizing\\ncritical sections, and shortening the context to be processed.\\n2https://www.llamaindex.ai\\n3https://www.langchain.com/\\nC. Modular RAG\\nThe modular RAG architecture advances beyond the for-\\nmer two RAG paradigms, offering enhanced adaptability and\\nversatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its\\ncomponents, such as adding a search module for similarity\\nsearches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning. Inno-\\nvations like restructured RAG modules [13] and rearranged\\nRAG pipelines [14] have been introduced to tackle specific\\nchallenges. The shift towards a modular RAG approach is\\nbecoming prevalent, supporting both sequential processing and\\nintegrated end-to-end training across its components. Despite\\nits distinctiveness, Modular RAG builds upon the foundational\\nprinciples of Advanced and Naive RAG, illustrating a progres-\\nsion and refinement within the RAG family.\\n1) New Modules: The Modular RAG framework introduces\\nadditional specialized components to enhance retrieval and\\nprocessing capabilities. The Search module adapts to spe-\\ncific scenarios, enabling direct searches across various data\\nsources like search engines, databases, and knowledge graphs,\\nusing LLM-generated code and query languages [15]. RAG-\\nFusion addresses traditional search limitations by employing\\na multi-query strategy that expands user queries into diverse\\nperspectives, utilizing parallel vector searches and intelligent\\nre-ranking to uncover both explicit and transformative knowl-\\nedge [16].

The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy\\nand noise by generating context directly through the LLM,\\nensuring relevance and accuracy [13]. Lastly, the Task Adapter\\nmodule tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating\\nprompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific\\nretrievers through few-shot query generation [20], [21] .This\\ncomprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval pro-\\ncess but also significantly improves the quality and relevance\\nof the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks\\nand queries with enhanced precision and flexibility.\\n2) New Patterns: Modular RAG offers remarkable adapt-\\nability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration\\nto address specific challenges. This goes beyond the fixed\\nstructures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a\\nsimple “Retrieve” and “Read” mechanism. Moreover, Modular\\nRAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or\\nadjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its\\napplicability across different tasks.\\nInnovations such as the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [7]model\\nleverage the LLM’s capabilities to refine retrieval queries\\nthrough a rewriting module and a LM-feedback mechanism\\nto update rewriting model., improving task performance.\\nSimilarly, approaches like Generate-Read [13] replace tradi-\\ntional retrieval with LLM-generated content, while Recite-\\nRead [22] emphasizes retrieval from model weights, enhanc-\\ning the model’s ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks.\\nHybrid retrieval strategies integrate keyword, semantic, and\\nvector searches to cater to diverse queries. Additionally, em-\\nploying sub-queries and hypothetical document embeddings\\n(HyDE) [11] seeks to improve retrieval relevance by focusing\\non embedding similarities between generated answers and real\\ndocuments.\\nAdjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such\\nas the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework\\nand the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITER-\\nRETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module out-\\nputs to bolster another module’s functionality, illustrating a\\nsophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy.\\nThe flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases\\nthe benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques such as\\nFLARE [24] and Self-RAG [25]. This approach transcends\\nthe fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity\\nof retrieval based on different scenarios. Another benefit of\\na flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more\\neasily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning\\nor reinforcement learning) [26]. For example, this can involve\\nfine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning\\nthe generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in\\ncollaborative fine-tuning [27].\\nD. RAG vs Fine-tuning\\nThe augmentation of LLMs has attracted considerable atten-\\ntion due to their growing prevalence. Among the optimization\\nmethods for LLMs, RAG is often compared with Fine-tuning\\n(FT) and prompt engineering. Each method has distinct charac-\\nteristics as illustrated in Figure 4. We used a quadrant chart to\\nillustrate the differences among three methods in two dimen-\\nsions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption\\nrequirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model’s inherent\\ncapabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge\\nand model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model\\nwith a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for pre-\\ncise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable\\nto a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for\\nscenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or\\nformats.\\nRAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-\\ntime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external\\nknowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it\\ncomes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding\\ndata retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring\\nretraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the\\nmodel’s behavior and style. It demands significant compu-\\ntational resources for dataset preparation and training, and\\nwhile it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with\\nunfamiliar data.\\nIn multiple evaluations of their performance on various\\nknowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] re-\\nvealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some im-\\nprovement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both exist-\\ning knowledge encountered during training and entirely new\\nknowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle\\nto learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-\\ntuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the\\nspecific needs for data dynamics, customization, and com-\\nputational capabilities in the application context. RAG and\\nFT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each\\nother, enhancing a model’s capabilities at different levels.\\nIn some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal\\nperformance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT\\nmay require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\\nIII. RETRIEVAL\\nIn the context of RAG, it is crucial to efficiently retrieve\\nrelevant documents from the data source. There are several\\nkey issues involved, such as the retrieval source, retrieval\\ngranularity, pre-processing of the retrieval, and selection of\\nthe corresponding embedding model.\\nA. Retrieval Source\\nRAG relies on external knowledge to enhance LLMs, while\\nthe type of retrieval source and the granularity of retrieval\\nunits both affect the final generation results.\\n1) Data Structure: Initially, text is s the mainstream source\\nof retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval source expanded to in-\\nclude semi-structured data (PDF) and structured data (Knowl-\\nedge Graph, KG) for enhancement. In addition to retrieving\\nfrom original external sources, there is also a growing trend in\\nrecent researches towards utilizing content generated by LLMs\\nthemselves for retrieval and enhancement purposes.'),\n",

RAG compared with other model optimization methods in the aspects of “External Knowledge Required” and “Model Adaption Required”. Prompt\\nEngineering requires low modifications to the model and external knowledge, focusing on harnessing the capabilities of LLMs themselves. Fine-tuning, on\\nthe other hand, involves further training the model. In the early stages of RAG (Naive RAG), there is a low demand for model modifications. As research\\nprogresses, Modular RAG has become more integrated with fine-tuning techniques.\\nUnstructured Data, such as text, is the most widely used\\nretrieval source, which are mainly gathered from corpus. For\\nopen-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks, the primary\\nretrieval sources are Wikipedia Dump with the current major\\nversions including HotpotQA 4 (1st October , 2017), DPR5 (20\\nDecember, 2018). In addition to encyclopedic data, common\\nunstructured data includes cross-lingual text [19] and domain-\\nspecific data (such as medical [67]and legal domains [29]).\\nSemi-structured data. typically refers to data that contains a\\ncombination of text and table information, such as PDF. Han-\\ndling semi-structured data poses challenges for conventional\\nRAG systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, text splitting\\nprocesses may inadvertently separate tables, leading to data\\ncorruption during retrieval. Secondly, incorporating tables into\\nthe data can complicate semantic similarity searches. When\\ndealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves lever-\\naging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL\\nqueries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85].\\nAlternatively, tables can be transformed into text format for\\nfurther analysis using text-based methods [75]. However, both\\nof these methods are not optimal solutions, indicating substan-\\ntial research opportunities in this area.\\nStructured data, such as knowledge graphs (KGs) [86] ,\\nwhich are typically verified and can provide more precise in-\\nformation. KnowledGPT [15] generates KB search queries and\\nstores knowledge in a personalized base, enhancing the RAG\\nmodel’s knowledge richness. In response to the limitations of\\nLLMs in understanding and answering questions about textual\\ngraphs, G-Retriever [84] integrates Graph Neural Networks\\n4https://hotpotqa.github.io/wiki-readme.html\\n5https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR\\n(GNNs), LLMs and RAG, enhancing graph comprehension\\nand question-answering capabilities through soft prompting\\nof the LLM, and employs the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree\\n(PCST) optimization problem for targeted graph retrieval. On\\nthe contrary, it requires additional effort to build, validate,\\nand maintain structured databases. On the contrary, it requires\\nadditional effort to build, validate, and maintain structured\\ndatabases.\\nLLMs-Generated Content. Addressing the limitations of\\nexternal auxiliary information in RAG, some research has\\nfocused on exploiting LLMs’ internal knowledge. SKR [58]\\nclassifies questions as known or unknown, applying retrieval\\nenhancement selectively. GenRead [13] replaces the retriever\\nwith an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated contexts\\noften contain more accurate answers due to better alignment\\nwith the pre-training objectives of causal language modeling.\\nSelfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool\\nwith a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selec-\\ntor to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the\\noriginal question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.\\nThese methodologies underscore the breadth of innovative\\ndata source utilization in RAG, striving to improve model\\nperformance and task effectiveness.\\n2) Retrieval Granularity: Another important factor besides\\nthe data format of the retrieval source is the granularity of\\nthe retrieved data. Coarse-grained retrieval units theoretically\\ncan provide more relevant information for the problem, but\\nthey may also contain redundant content, which could distract\\nthe retriever and language models in downstream tasks [50],\\n[87]. On the other hand, fine-grained retrieval unit granularity\\nincreases the burden of retrieval and does not guarantee seman-\\ntic integrity and meeting the required knowledge. Choosing'),\n",

Among them, DenseX [30]proposed the concept of\\nusing propositions as retrieval units. Propositions are defined\\nas atomic expressions in the text, each encapsulating a unique\\nfactual segment and presented in a concise, self-contained nat-\\nural language format. This approach aims to enhance retrieval\\nprecision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG),\\nretrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph.\\nThe granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream\\ntasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks\\nand Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in\\nTable I.\\nB. Indexing Optimization\\nIn the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, seg-\\nmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a\\nvector database. The quality of index construction determines\\nwhether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval\\nphase.\\n1) Chunking Strategy: The most common method is to split\\nthe document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g.,\\n100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context,\\nbut they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing\\ntime and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully\\nconvey the necessary context, they do have less noise. How-\\never, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting\\nthe optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window meth-\\nods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related\\ninformation across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Never-\\ntheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between\\nsemantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods\\nlike Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small)\\nare used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following\\nsentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\\n2) Metadata Attachments: Chunks can be enriched with\\nmetadata information such as page number, file name, au-\\nthor,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered\\nbased on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval.\\nAssigning different weights to document timestamps during\\nretrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness\\nof knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\\nIn addition to extracting metadata from the original doc-\\numents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For\\nexample, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as intro-\\nducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as\\nReverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions\\nthat can be answered by the document, then calculating the\\nsimilarity between the original question and the hypothetical\\nquestion during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between\\nthe question and the answer.\\n3) Structural Index: One effective method for enhancing\\ninformation retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for\\nthe documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can\\nexpedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.\\nHierarchical index structure. File are arranged in parent-\\nchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data sum-\\nmaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal\\nof data and assisting the RAG system in determining which\\nchunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion\\ncaused by block extraction issues.\\nKnowledge Graph index. Utilize KG in constructing the\\nhierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining\\nconsistency. It delineates the connections between different\\nconcepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for\\nillusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the\\ninformation retrieval process into instructions that LLM can\\ncomprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge\\nretrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent\\nresponses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG\\nsystem. To capture the logical relationship between document\\ncontent and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building\\nan index between multiple documents using KG. This KG\\nconsists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the\\ndocuments, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating\\nsemantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships\\nwithin the document structure), effectively addressing knowl-\\nedge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document\\nenvironment.\\nC. Query Optimization\\nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its\\ndirect reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for\\nretrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult,\\nand imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness.\\nSometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language\\nis not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language\\ncomplexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when\\ndealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbrevi-\\nations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not\\ndiscern whether “LLM” refers to large language model or a\\nMaster of Laws in a legal context.\\n1) Query Expansion: Expanding a single query into mul-\\ntiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing\\nfurther context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby\\nensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.\\nMulti-Query. By employing prompt engineering to expand\\nqueries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in\\nparallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather\\nmeticulously designed.\\nSub-Query. The process of sub-question planning represents\\nthe generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize\\nand fully answer the original question when combined. This\\nprocess of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar\\nto query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be\\ndecomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the\\nleast-to-most prompting method [92].\\nChain-of-Verification(CoVe). The expanded queries undergo\\nvalidation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing halluci-\\nnations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher\\nreliability [93].'),\n",

There-\\nfore, we can prompt LLM to rewrite the queries. In addition to\\nusing LLM for query rewriting, specialized smaller language\\nmodels, such as RRR (Rewrite-retrieve-read) [7]. The imple-\\nmentation of the query rewrite method in the Taobao, known\\nas BEQUE [9] has notably enhanced recall effectiveness for\\nlong-tail queries, resulting in a rise in GMV.\\nAnother query transformation method is to use prompt\\nengineering to let LLM generate a query based on the original\\nquery for subsequent retrieval. HyDE [11] construct hypothet-\\nical documents (assumed answers to the original query). It\\nfocuses on embedding similarity from answer to answer rather\\nthan seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query.\\nUsing the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original\\nquery is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question\\n(step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back\\nquestion and the original query are used for retrieval, and both\\nthe results are utilized as the basis for language model answer\\ngeneration.\\n3) Query Routing: Based on varying queries, routing to\\ndistinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG\\nsystem designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.\\nMetadata Router/ Filter. The first step involves extracting\\nkeywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based\\non the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow\\ndown the search scope.\\nSemantic Router is another method of routing involves\\nleveraging the semantic information of the query. Specific\\napprach see Semantic Router 6. Certainly, a hybrid routing\\napproach can also be employed, combining both semantic and\\nmetadata-based methods for enhanced query routing.\\nD. Embedding\\nIn RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity\\n(e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the ques-\\ntion and document chunks, where the semantic representation\\ncapability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly\\nincludes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT\\narchitecture Pre-training language models). Recent research\\nhas introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE,\\nVoyage, BGE,etc [94]–[96], which are benefit from multi-task\\ninstruct tuning. Hugging Face’s MTEB leaderboard 7 evaluates\\nembedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Ad-\\nditionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering\\n6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer\\nto “which embedding model to use.” However, some specific\\nmodels are better suited for particular use cases.\\n1) Mix/hybrid Retrieval : Sparse and dense embedding\\napproaches capture different relevance features and can ben-\\nefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance\\ninformation. For instance, sparse retrieval models can be used\\n6https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router\\n7https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard\\nto provide initial search results for training dense retrieval\\nmodels. Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs)\\ncan be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse\\nretrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval\\nmodels can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense\\nretrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries\\ncontaining rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\\n2) Fine-tuning Embedding Model: In instances where the\\ncontext significantly deviates from pre-training corpus, partic-\\nularly within highly specialized disciplines such as healthcare,\\nlegal practice, and other sectors replete with proprietary jargon,\\nfine-tuning the embedding model on your own domain dataset\\nbecomes essential to mitigate such discrepancies.\\nIn addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another\\npurpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator,\\nfor example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal\\nfor fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever).\\nPROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query\\ngenerator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing chal-\\nlenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce\\ndomains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits\\nLLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream\\ntasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised\\nsignals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from\\nthe LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective\\nfine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse\\ndownstream applications.

In this\\napproach, the retriever module is directly substituted to gen-\\nerate relevant documents according to a query. This method\\nassists in addressing the difficulties encountered during the\\nfine-tuning process and enhances model performance.\\nIV. GENERATION\\nAfter retrieval, it is not a good practice to directly input all\\nthe retrieved information to the LLM for answering questions.\\nFollowing will introduce adjustments from two perspectives:\\nadjusting the retrieved content and adjusting the LLM.\\nA. Context Curation\\nRedundant information can interfere with the final gener-\\nation of LLM, and overly long contexts can also lead LLM\\nto the “Lost in the middle” problem [98]. Like humans, LLM\\ntends to only focus on the beginning and end of long texts,\\nwhile forgetting the middle portion. Therefore, in the RAG\\nsystem, we typically need to further process the retrieved\\ncontent.\\n1) Reranking: Reranking fundamentally reorders document\\nchunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, effectively\\nreducing the overall document pool, severing a dual purpose\\nin information retrieval, acting as both an enhancer and a\\nfilter, delivering refined inputs for more precise language\\nmodel processing [70]. Reranking can be performed using\\nrule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like\\nDiversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches\\nlike Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g.,\\nSpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere\\nrerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language mod-\\nels like GPT [12], [99].\\n2) Context Selection/Compression: A common misconcep-\\ntion in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many\\nrelevant documents as possible and concatenating them to form\\na lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive\\ncontext can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM’s\\nperception of key information .\\n(Long) LLMLingua [100], [101] utilize small language\\nmodels (SLMs) such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B, to\\ndetect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming it into\\na form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but\\nwell understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct\\nand practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the\\nneed for additional training of LLMs while balancing language\\nintegrity and compression ratio. PRCA tackled this issue by\\ntraining an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP\\nadopts a comparable approach by training an information\\ncondenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data\\npoint consists of one positive sample and five negative sam-\\nples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss\\nthroughout this process [102] .\\nIn addition to compressing the context, reducing the num-\\nber of documents aslo helps improve the accuracy of the\\nmodel’s answers. Ma et al. [103] propose the “Filter-Reranker”\\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.\\nIn this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\\nas reordering agents. The research shows that instructing\\nLLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs\\nleads to significant improvements in various Information\\nExtraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective\\napproach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved\\ncontent before generating the final answer. This allows the\\nLLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM\\ncritique. For instance, in Chatlaw [104], the LLM is prompted\\nto self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess\\ntheir relevance.\\nB. LLM Fine-tuning\\nTargeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data char-\\nacteristics on LLMs can yield better results. This is also one\\nof the greatest advantages of using on-premise LLMs. When\\nLLMs lack data in a specific domain, additional knowledge can\\nbe provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. Huggingface’s\\nfine-tuning data can also be used as an initial step.\\nAnother benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the\\nmodel’s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to\\nadapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a par-\\nticular style as instructed [37]. For retrieval tasks that engage\\nwith structured data, the SANTA framework [76] implements\\na tripartite training regimen to effectively encapsulate both\\nstructural and semantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on\\nthe retriever, where contrastive learning is harnessed to refine\\nthe query and document embeddings.\\nAligning LLM outputs with human or retriever preferences\\nthrough reinforcement learning is a potential approach. For\\ninstance, manually annotating the final generated answers\\nand then providing feedback through reinforcement learning.\\nIn addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also\\npossible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models\\nand retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to\\npowerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source\\nmodels, a simple and effective method is to distill the more\\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align pref-\\nerences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\\ndivergence.\\nV. AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insuffi-\\ncient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\\nA. Iterative Retrieval\\nIterative retrieval is a process where the knowledge base\\nis repeatedly searched based on the initial query and the text\\ngenerated so far, providing a more comprehensive knowledge'),\n",

In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves\\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discon-\\ntinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITER-\\nRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that lever-\\nages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generation-\\nenhanced retrieval” for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\\nof specific information. The model harnesses the content\\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\\nB. Recursive Retrieval\\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\\non the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu-\\nally converging on the most pertinent information through a\\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\\nthe user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\\nand adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in\\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive\\nretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\\nC. Adaptive Retrieval\\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\\ninformation sourced.\\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and Graph-\\nToolformer [107]–[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, di-\\nvides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and em-\\nploy few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning frame-\\nwork to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\\nexpanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external\\nsearch engines.

When the probability falls\\nbelow a certain threshold would activates the retrieval system\\nto collect relevant information, thus optimizing the retrieval\\ncycle. Self-RAG [25] introduces “reflection tokens” that allow\\nthe model to introspect its outputs. These tokens come in\\ntwo varieties: “retrieve” and “critic”. The model autonomously\\ndecides when to activate retrieval, or alternatively, a predefined\\nthreshold may trigger the process. During retrieval, the gen-\\nerator conducts a fragment-level beam search across multiple\\nparagraphs to derive the most coherent sequence. Critic scores\\nare used to update the subdivision scores, with the flexibility\\nto adjust these weights during inference, tailoring the model’s\\nbehavior. Self-RAG’s design obviates the need for additional\\nclassifiers or reliance on Natural Language Inference (NLI)\\nmodels, thus streamlining the decision-making process for\\nwhen to engage retrieval mechanisms and improving the\\nmodel’s autonomous judgment capabilities in generating ac-\\ncurate responses.\\nVI. TASK AND EVALUATION\\nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG\\nin the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG\\nmodels to the forefront of research in the LLMs community.\\nThe primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend\\nand optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse\\napplication scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the\\nmain downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate\\nRAG systems.\\nA. Downstream Task\\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\\nincluding\\ntraditional\\nsingle-hop/multi-hop\\nQA,\\nmultiple-\\nchoice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios\\nsuitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously\\nbeing expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Infor-\\nmation Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc.\\nThe main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding\\ndatasets are summarized in Table II.\\nB. Evaluation Target\\nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on\\ntheir execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations\\nemploy established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For\\ninstance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM\\nand F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking\\ntasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4],\\n[14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly\\nused to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools\\nlike RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG\\napplications, similarly base their assessments on these task-\\nspecific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity\\nof research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics\\nof RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include:\\nRetrieval Quality. Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial\\nfor determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by\\nthe retriever component. Standard metrics from the domains\\nof search engines, recommendation systems, and information\\nretrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of\\nthe RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162].\\nGeneration Quality. The assessment of generation quality\\ncenters on the generator’s capacity to synthesize coherent and\\nrelevant answers from the retrieved context. This evaluation\\ncan be categorized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled\\nand labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation\\nencompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness\\nof the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content,\\nthe focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by\\nthe model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation\\nquality assessments can be conducted through manual or\\nautomatic evaluation methods [29], [161], [163].\\nC. Evaluation Aspects\\nContemporary evaluation practices of RAG models empha-\\nsize three primary quality scores and four essential abilities,\\nwhich collectively inform the evaluation of the two principal\\ntargets of the RAG model: retrieval and generation.\\n1) Quality Scores: Quality scores include context rele-\\nvance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. These qual-\\nity scores evaluate the efficiency of the RAG model from\\ndifferent perspectives in the process of information retrieval\\nand generation [164]–[166].\\nContext Relevance evaluates the precision and specificity\\nof the retrieved context, ensuring relevance and minimizing\\nprocessing costs associated with extraneous content.\\nAnswer Faithfulness ensures that the generated answers\\nremain true to the retrieved context, maintaining consistency\\nand avoiding contradictions.\\nAnswer Relevance requires that the generated answers are\\ndirectly pertinent to the posed questions, effectively addressing\\nthe core inquiry.\\n2) Required Abilities: RAG evaluation also encompasses\\nfour abilities indicative of its adaptability and efficiency:\\nnoise robustness, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness [167], [168]. These abilities are\\ncritical for the model’s performance under various challenges\\nand complex scenarios, impacting the quality scores.\\nNoise Robustness appraises the model’s capability to man-\\nage noise documents that are question-related but lack sub-\\nstantive information.\\nNegative Rejection assesses the model’s discernment in\\nrefraining from responding when the retrieved documents do\\nnot contain the necessary knowledge to answer a question.\\nInformation Integration evaluates the model’s proficiency in\\nsynthesizing information from multiple documents to address\\ncomplex questions.\\nCounterfactual Robustness tests the model’s ability to rec-\\nognize and disregard known inaccuracies within documents,\\neven when instructed about potential misinformation.\\nContext relevance and noise robustness are important for\\nevaluating the quality of retrieval, while answer faithfulness,\\nanswer relevance, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness are important for evaluating the\\nquality of generation.'),\n",

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS\\nDespite the considerable progress in RAG technology, sev-\\neral challenges persist that warrant in-depth research.This\\nchapter will mainly introduce the current challenges and future\\nresearch directions faced by RAG.\\nA. RAG vs Long Context\\nWith the deepening of related research, the context of LLMs\\nis continuously expanding [170]–[172]. Presently, LLMs can\\neffortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens 9. This\\ncapability signifies that long-document question answering,\\npreviously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire\\ndocument directly into the prompt. This has also sparked\\ndiscussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\\n8https://www.trulens.org/trulens eval/core concepts rag triad/\\n9https://kimi.moonshot.cn\\nare not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an\\nirreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a\\nlarge amount of context at once will significantly impact its\\ninference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input\\ncan significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other\\nhand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original\\nreferences for LLMs to help users verify the generated an-\\nswers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable,\\nwhile generation solely relying on long context remains a\\nblack box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new\\nopportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to\\naddress more complex problems and integrative or summary\\nquestions that require reading a large amount of material to\\nanswer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of\\nsuper-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\\nB. RAG Robustness\\nThe presence of noise or contradictory information during\\nretrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s output quality. This\\nsituation is figuratively referred to as “Misinformation can\\nbe worse than no information at all”. Improving RAG’s\\nresistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gain-\\ning research momentum and has become a key performance\\nmetric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which\\ntype of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance\\nof the documents to the prompt, their position, and the\\nnumber included in the context. The research findings reveal\\nthat including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase\\naccuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption\\nof reduced quality. These results underscore the importance\\nof developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with\\nlanguage generation models, highlighting the need for further\\nresearch and exploration into the robustness of RAG.\\nC.

Another trend is to introduce SLMs with specific\\nfunctionalities into RAG and fine-tuned by the results of RAG\\nsystem. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval\\nevaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved docu-\\nments for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval\\nactions based on confidence levels.\\nD.

Summary of RAG ecosystem\\ninitial learning curve. 3) Specialization - optimizing RAG to\\nbetter serve production environments.\\nThe mutual growth of RAG models and their technology\\nstacks is evident; technological advancements continuously\\nestablish new standards for existing infrastructure. In turn,\\nenhancements to the technology stack drive the development\\nof RAG capabilities. RAG toolkits are converging into a\\nfoundational technology stack, laying the groundwork for\\nadvanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated,\\ncomprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring\\nfurther innovation and development.\\nF. Multi-modal RAG\\nRAG\\nhas\\ntranscended\\nits\\ninitial\\ntext-based\\nquestion-\\nanswering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.\\nThis expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models\\nthat integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\nImage. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal\\nmodel of both retrieving and generating text and images.\\nBLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside\\nLLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero-\\nshot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You\\nWrite” method [178] employs image generation to steer the\\nLM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text\\ngeneration tasks.\\nAudio and Video. The GSS method retrieves and stitches\\ntogether audio clips to convert machine-translated data into\\nspeech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad-\\nvancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by\\nincorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con-\\nversion [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever-\\nages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed-\\ndings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.\\nVid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal\\nmarkers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and\\ntextual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].\\nCode. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by\\nretrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives\\nthrough encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has\\ndemonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera-\\ntion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK\\nmethod [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query\\nfrom a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints\\nwithin the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph\\nquestion-answering tasks.\\nVIII. CONCLUSION\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha-\\nsizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa-\\nbilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from\\nlanguage models with extensive non-parameterized data from\\nexternal knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution\\nof RAG technologies and their application on many different\\ntasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms\\nwithin the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu-\\nlar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over\\nits predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI\\nmethodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,\\nhas further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in\\nRAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve\\nits robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.\\nRAG’s application scope is expanding into multimodal do-\\nmains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse\\ndata forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion high-\\nlights RAG’s significant practical implications for AI deploy-\\nment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.'),\n",
